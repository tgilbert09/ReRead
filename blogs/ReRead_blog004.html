      <h2>ReRead's Plan to 100 Book Requests</h2>
      <p id="author_date">19th August 2024</p>
      <p>
        This blog post was written after an existential ReRead crisis but I
        wanted to record where my mind was at pre-19th August. It’s written in
        the present tense as if it were still the plan. Also as a side note, I’m
        thinking about posting blog posts more frequently - to do this I’m going
        to proofread less - so things may not make sense or flow as well. Open
        to thoughts and feedback (through any of ReRead’s social media).
      </p>

      <h3>The short term plan</h3>
      <p>
        Get to at least 100 books requested through the ReRead website from at
        least 15 different customers, at least 4 of which are total strangers
        that I have had no contact with. Each customer requesting between 6 and
        7 books on average. Achieve this by 15th September 2024.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 4 strangers would be for validating that it’s not just close friends
        and family being “nice” and requesting books through ReRead. These 4
        strangers are to be acquired through the poster and the short form video
        posted on ReRead’s social media.
      </p>

      What I hope to achieve? This is to assess the hypotheses that:
      <ol>
        <li>People want to buy books from charity shops over online giants.</li>
        <li>
          People are happy to trade convenience/next-day delivery by sharing
          their want-to-read lists and sitting tight.
        </li>
        <li>
          5% of books requested are available to purchase in local charity
          shops.
        </li>
        <li>
          The charity shops would be willing to reserve a book over a phone call
          (would be through an app notification in the future) and hold it for
          the ReRead customer who requested the book
        </li>
        <li>
          People are happy to go ahead and pay a £1 fee before finding out how
          much the charity shop is charging for the book.
        </li>
        <li>
          People will go and collect their books in reasonable times so the
          charity shops are not dealing with overheads from managing a pile of
          reserved ReRead books
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>The logic behind using the book request format</h3>
      <p>
        By taking requests I do not need to build any complicated back ends. I
        can go around charity shops talking photos of the shelves - this way, if
        I get new requests, I can check photos to see if I’ve seen the book
        before. While I am in the shop, I check the shelves against an
        alphabetically ordered list of ReRead’s first 100 requested books (most
        charity shops order their books alphabetically by authors last name,
        however some seem to be grouped by colour for aesthetics - this is
        mostly done in shops with only a few books but it does make finding the
        books much harder.)
      </p>

      <img src="booksSortedByColour.jpeg" />

      <p>
        Once I find a reserved book, I walk out of the charity shop, leaving the
        book on the shelf (sounds counter intuitive).
      </p>

      <p>
        I have spoken to some amazing Oxfam bookshop owners, they are happy to
        take phone calls and search their shops for books. I would do this and
        ask them to reserve the book (the one I just found myself in their shop)
        and let them know that a ReRead customer will be around to collect it
        soon. I then email the ReRead customer saying I have found their
        request, checking they are still happy to pay the £1 fee. If they are,
        then I take the £1 request fee payment and tell them where the book is
        reserved so they can collect it and pay the charity for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach therefore relies heavily on marketing to build an initial
        customer base and 100 book requests. It provides valuable learnings,
        testing assumptions about customers and their behaviours. The MVP is me,
        there is no back end. I do the searching and there is little/no fancy
        scanning technology or database. The idea is to learn as much as
        possible by doing as little as possible, as suggested by the book “The
        Lean Start-up”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to present day me, I recently created a financial model and scoped
        out the request mechanisms. I’ve had some serious thoughts about how
        scalable this request feature is as a revenue source for ReRead. I am
        now thinking about working on something more technically involved over
        the next few months to create a more enticing MVP (minimum viable
        product). Although I have not tested the hypotheses I have laid out
        above, I have just gone over it again and again in my head. This is
        potentially not ideal and I may be “pivoting” without giving this a
        proper go. The new MVP I am thinking about switching to would aim to
        delete the need to test many of the hypotheses mentioned above as
        different (and hopefully fewer and smaller!) assumptions will be made.
        Maybe it’s a bit like the saying “no part is the best part” but somehow
        translated to assumptions - “smaller and fewer assumptions are the best
        assumptions” (??) - so catchy. To be continued..
