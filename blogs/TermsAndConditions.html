      <h2>Terms and Conditions for ReRead</h2>
      <p id="author_date">10th October 2024</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Introduction</b> Welcome to ReRead! By using our website and
          services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms
          and Conditions. Please read these carefully before using the platform.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Services Provided</b> ReRead allows users to create wishlists of
          books and notifies them if their desired book is found in a
          participating charity shop. Registered users can also log in and
          search for books, with access to additional information such as the
          locations of books previously seen in charity shops.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>User Accounts</b> To access certain features of our service, users
          are required to create an account. You are responsible for
          safeguarding your login credentials and agree not to share them with
          anyone. ReRead is not liable for any unauthorized access resulting
          from your failure to protect your login information.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Wishlist Feature</b> Users can add books to their wishlist by
          searching for books through Google Books. Instead of manually
          providing book details (such as title and author), users will select a
          book from the search results, and a reference to that book (including
          a link to Google Books) will be added to their wishlist. If ReRead
          identifies the requested book in a participating charity shop, users
          will be notified. However, ReRead cannot guarantee the availability or
          condition of any book found through this process.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Notifications</b> ReRead will notify users via email or in-app
          notifications if a book from their wishlist is found. These
          notifications are provided as a convenience, and ReRead does not
          guarantee that notifications will be timely or accurate.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Book Location Access</b> Users who are logged in will be able to
          access the locations of books previously seen in charity shops. This
          information is based on the data collected and may not always reflect
          the current status of a bookâ€™s availability.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Content Ownership</b> All content provided by ReRead, including
          images, text, and logos, are owned by ReRead or our partners. You are
          not allowed to copy, distribute, or create derivative works from this
          content without permission.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>User-Provided Content</b> By submitting content (such as book
          wishlists) to ReRead, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
          perpetual, and worldwide license to use, reproduce, and display that
          content for the purpose of providing our services.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Termination of Service</b> ReRead reserves the right to terminate
          or suspend any account that violates these terms or uses the service
          in an unlawful or inappropriate manner.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Limitation of Liability</b> ReRead is not responsible for any
          damages arising from the use or inability to use the platform. This
          includes, but is not limited to, lost data, inaccuracies, or delays in
          notifications.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Changes to Terms</b> ReRead reserves the right to modify these
          terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes are made
          constitutes acceptance of those changes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Contact Information</b> For any questions regarding these Terms and
          Conditions, please contact us at [hello@re-read.co.uk].
