      <h2>Measuring ReRead's Growth - Tech Blog</h2>
      <p id="author_date">20th August 2024</p>
      <p>
        I currently have no clue how much traction the
        <a href="https://re-read.co.uk">ReRead website</a> is getting. I need to
        know this if I am to have any hope of understanding how ReRead is doing
        and if it is growing.
        <a href="https://re-read.co.uk">ReRead's website</a> is hosted on a free
        plan (<a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a> for
        anyone interested - been amazing so far!). As far as I am aware I have
        two ways to do this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Host the website on my home network instead of on Cloudflare -
          probably on a Raspberry Pi with port forwarding and an
          <a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache HTTP Server</a>. This way I
          think I’d be able to monitor the traffic hitting the server directly.
          My home internet is provided by Virgin Media. I currently just got a
          20.2 Mbps upload speed which I think is easily enough to host what is
          currently a very simple website. The only other small complication is
          that I’m not sure my IP address will stay constant. If I tell
          Cloudflare (my domain service provider) to point
          <a href="https://re-read.co.uk">re-read.co.uk</a> to my public IP
          address, let’s say it’s 8.8.8.8 - great the website works. But then
          tomorrow, my public IP lease expires and Virgin Media decides to
          change my public IP to 8.8.4.4 - the website goes down, because it’s
          no longer at 8.8.8.8. It looks like
          <a
            href="https://www.virginmediabusiness.co.uk/help-and-advice/products-and-services/static-and-dynamic-ip-addresses-explained/"
            >Virgin Media do offer static public IP addresses</a
          >, but you need to be on a business account and tell them at time of
          setup - this is not viable. However, on further reading it looks like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS">Dynamic DNS</a> is
          my solution, I would be able to run a script on the Raspberry Pi to
          monitor my public IP address and then tap into the
          <a
            href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/managing-dynamic-ip-addresses/"
            >Cloudflare API</a
          >
          to change the IP address
          <a href="https://re-read.co.uk">re-read.co.uk</a> points to. So the
          Raspberry Pi would see the change in IP address and tell Cloudflare
          the new IP address. It also looks like someone has already written
          this script so it would be as simple as installing a package -
          <a href="https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient">ddclient</a>! This is a
          very possible solution. The positives to this self hosting method are
          that it should be easy to get a database (SQL type thing) running on
          the Pi and it would all just “be there” for me to setup. The downside
          may be - I have all this raw data from the server and I have to work
          out how to process it - I could spend all my days making graphs and
          fiddling with things..
        </li>
        <li>
          Work out how to use something like
          <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/"
            >Google Analytics</a
          >
          (it sounds mildly privacy invading - privacy will be a core foundation
          to ReRead) or something like
          <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible</a> which is open source and
          might be nicer? I believe these are just lines of Javascript that are
          added to each page and pings Google’s servers?
          <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12159447?hl=en">
            Yes, that’s pretty much it </a
          >. Google Analytics looks to be free at the volumes I’m looking at for
          now. I’ve just stumbled across
          <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics/"
            >Cloudflare data analytics</a
          >, it’s free and advocates for privacy first - I am falling in love
          with Cloudflare. This means ReRead's website would be hosted on
          Cloudflare, the
          <a href="https://re-read.co.uk">re-read.co.uk</a> domain (DNS magic)
          managed by Cloudflare, and data analytics also managed by Cloudflare.
          Almost fully Cloudflare, apart from one thing, it's actually
          <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102540"
            >Apple/iCloud hosting the email server</a
          >
          for @re-read.co.uk as it was included for free in my iCloud plan!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The solution I’m going to go with is Cloudflare for data analytics, one
        day I’d like to be able to have a view counter on my blog posts - maybe
        Cloudflare will make a view counter possible! This means, once I’ve
        integrated it, I will be able to see how many people view the ReRead
        website, and I can test what gets people interested and onto the site.
